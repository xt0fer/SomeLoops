# SomeLoops

a series of smaller exercises for loops.

## Method
* examine each problem,
* discuss keys to solutions
* write pseudocode soln
* write java code.

## Problems
1. Sum the numbers from 9 to 17 and print result.
2. Print each number from the array
  * array is [ 5, 6, 8, 45, 2, 13, 71 ]
2.5 Find the smallest number in an array of integers.
  * array is [ 5, 6, 8, 45, 2, 13, 71 ]
3. Find the largest double number in an array.
  * array is [ 104.5, 62.7, 513.897, 402, 91.7 ]
4. Find and print the index of the  `true` element in a boolean array.
  * array is [ false, false, false, false, false, false, true, false, false, false, false,  ]
5. Find a the first number greater than parameter `m` in an array. Print the index and the number found.
  * array is [ 5, 6, 8, 45, 2, 13, 71 ]
  * `m` is 28
6. With an array of transaction objects and nulls, calculate the sum of all the transaction values, using the `transactionValue` method on each found object.
  * array is [ t1, t4, null, t6, null, t8, null, t9 ]
  * `public double transactionValue()`
7. Reverse an array of objects.
  * array is [ t1, t4, t3, t6, t82, t8, t7, t9 ]
